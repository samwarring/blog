Hi, I'm Sam. This is my blog.

I've been programming in C++ since 2009, and I just keep going. Despite all the mean things that have been said about it (and I'm guilty as well), it remains my favorite programming language. Working with C++, I soon discovered CMake, which has also become another fascination of mine. In this blog, expect to read a lot about them both!

I currently live in San Francisco, CA where I work remotely full-time as a Software Engineer at a startup. When I'm not programming for work, I'm probably programming for fun. And when I'm not doing either of those, I'm out on a walk, maintaining a trail, cooking, or just watching Netflix like the rest of us! My favorite musician is [Jonathan Richman](https://youtu.be/XjFU98mEem4).
